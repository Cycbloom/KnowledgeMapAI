5. **Content Richness**: Every node must have substantial ''content'' description, not just a title.
6. IMPORTANT: All mathematical formulas in ''content'' must be wrapped in standard LaTeX delimiters. Use $...$ for inline formulas and $$...$$ for block formulas.

3. **Maintain Logic Chain**: Ensure edges accurately reflect parent-child inclusion. Every child MUST point to its direct parent ID.
4. **Clean Noise**: Ignore page numbers, headers, irrelevant symbols.

Output Requirements:
- Node titles must preserve core terminology.
- **Content Richness**: Each node MUST have substantial ''content'' (100-200 words), not just a title.
- Node count: 40-60 nodes to ensure completeness.
